When Christians are strengthened in the Lord they begin to demonstrate God's forgiveness and reach out in love even to their oppressors. One of the greatest challenges to Christians living under oppression is isolation - from God's word and from the body of Christ. 1 Corinthians 12:26 says ""If one member suffers all suffer together; if one member is honored all rejoice together."" Open Doors empowers persecuted Christians by supplying Bibles and Christian literature training Christian leaders facilitating social/economic projects and uniting believers in the West in prayer for Christians who are the most persecuted religious group in the world and are oppressed in at least 60 countries."

We began in 1990 on Telegraph Ave. as an all-volunteer organization dedicated to monitoring police actions and non-violently asserting our rights. Since that time many Copwatch-type organizations have sprung up across the nation in various forms. Berkeley Copwatch is based on the idea that WATCHING the police is a crucial first step in the process of organizing. We do not attempt to interfere in police activity or to resist police misconduct physically. It is our hope that one day mass outrage at police and government violence will increase to a point where fundamental change in the nature of policing becomes inevitable.

,,DarkMatter2525,UCLhtZqdkjshgq8TqwIjMdCQ,L,independent,existing,Cartoon Comedy Roasting Religion Nothing is Sacred. Question Everything. I don't address religion because of God; I address it because of the people who believe in God. I don't want them to believe in a fantasy. I want them to believe what is true. If most of the world believed in Harry Potter and based life decisions - that affect everyone - on that belief then I'd spend my time addressing Harry Potter. I don't know if a god exists but I do KNOW the Abrahamic God doesn't exist for He is an illogical concept rife with contradiction - a square circle of loving wrath known to have gone through an evolution as He was compiled by the ancients throughout history. This channel has always been mainly about criticism of religious ideas. I neither support nor condone the oppression of anybody because of their religion. People should be able to freely practice their religion as long as doing so does not entail infringing upon the rights of others. I am also known as DarkAntics.

Dr. Jordan Peterson has given me explicit permission to upload clips and the email exchange between us can be found in my community tabs. Jordan Peterson lectures have helped change my perspective on many ideas and expanded my view of the world or as he would put it brought my world into a higher resolution. I try to extract interesting ideas that I extrapolate from Jordan Peterson's talks. However others feedback is necessary to understand where my understanding falls short of the truth.

There was nobody around to point me in the correct direction as far as thinking critically about what I believed. I was allowed to believe ridiculous things like that Adam and Eve were real people and a global flood covered the earth. I felt stupid believing those things when they didn't make sense but I was told that was what I was supposed to believe. When I started thinking and realized I didn't buy the bullshit they were selling again I had no one to turn to. I felt alone. I don't want anyone else to feel like that. I don't want people to feel alone in questioning religion or in being irreligious. If I can help someone to not feel so alone because they aren't religious anymore then my efforts are more than worth my time.
